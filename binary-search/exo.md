## Exercise questions

1. We have a sorted list of 128 names and we are searching it using binary search. What's the max number of steps (guesses) it would take?

 - Binary search has a log2(n) time complexity.
 - This means the anwser is log2(128).
 - log2(128) = 7, because 2^7 = 128.

- The answer is 7 steps.

2. Now double the size of the list. What's the max number of steps now ?

- 128 * 2 = 256
- log2(256) = 8
- The anwser is 8 steps.
